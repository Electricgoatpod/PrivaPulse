# PrivaPulse
PrivaPulse is an autonomous, privacy-first agent that transforms real-time biometric wellness into shielded rewards on Monad by using EZKL proofs to navigate the X402 protocol without ever compromising user identity. 🧬🛡️ #ShipPrivateShipFast

⚡ Why Monad?
Health interventions require immediate feedback. We utilized Monad’s parallelized EVM execution to:

Handle real-time HRV data streams.

Verify ZK-proofs generated by EZKL with minimal latency.

Provide a seamless "Zen" experience without waiting for traditional block times.

🛡️ Why Unlink?
In the "The Stress Diagnose-Meditate (SDM)" Framework, every reward payout creates a public "on-chain fingerprint" that links a specific biometric event (like a stress spike) to a user’s public wallet address. Over time, this allows third parties to de-anonymize a user’s medical history simply by tracking reward transactions. We used Unlink to 'un-link' the health event from the financial reward. It turns a public medical record into a private wellness incentive.

🎨 Features
Apple Health Simulation: Mimics iOS 17 health permissions and real-time HRV monitoring.

Vibe-Engine: Automated 432Hz binaural drone triggers upon stress-spike detection (28ms HRV).

Shadow Dashboard: A "Blurred-by-Default" UI allowing for selective disclosure of health reputation via ZK-QR codes.
