# 💜 PrivaPulse

**Your stress. Your secret. Your reward.**

PrivaPulse is a biometric AI agent that pays you for managing stress—without exposing your health data. When your Apple Watch detects high stress, we guide you through a 5-minute recovery session. Our AI verifies you recovered (using zkML), and you earn instant crypto rewards via shielded transactions.

**The Innovation:** We prove your biological recovery happened WITHOUT revealing your heart rate, stress levels, or identity.

🧬 zkML Verification (EZKL) → ⚡ Instant Payout (Monad) → 🛡️ Private Transfer (Unlink)

## 🔥 The Problem We're Solving

**83% of US workers** suffer from work-related stress, costing the economy **$300B+ annually**.

### Why Existing Solutions Fail:
❌ **Wellness apps** use timers (easy to fake) and upload your health data to servers  
❌ **Corporate programs** track stress patterns, creating surveillance concerns  
❌ **Wearables** give you data but no intervention or incentive  

### PrivaPulse's Solution:
✅ **AI-verified recovery** (impossible to fake - your HRV must actually improve)  
✅ **Zero medical data exposure** (zkML proofs reveal nothing about your health)  
✅ **Instant financial incentive** (earn 1.0 $PRP in <1 second via Monad)  
✅ **Mathematical privacy** (Unlink makes your stress patterns unlinkable)  

**Result:** Employers can fund wellness without surveillance. You get paid to manage stress privately.

## ⚡ Why Monad?

Health interventions require immediate feedback. We utilized Monad's parallelized EVM execution to:

- Handle real-time HRV data streams.
- Verify ZK-proofs generated by EZKL with minimal latency.
- Provide a seamless "Zen" experience without waiting for traditional block times.

## 🛡️ Why Unlink?

In the "Stress Diagnose-Meditate (SDM)" Framework, every reward payout creates a public "on-chain fingerprint" that links a specific biometric event (like a stress spike) to a user's public wallet address. Over time, this allows third parties to de-anonymize a user's medical history simply by tracking reward transactions. We used Unlink to 'un-link' the health event from the financial reward. It turns a public medical record into a private wellness incentive.

## 🏗️ The "God Tier" Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why We Chose It | The User Benefit |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| 🧠 **Intelligence** | EZKL (zkML) | Proves AI confirmed your stress recovery without exposing biometric data | Your heart rate never leaves your phone |
| ⚡ **Execution** | Monad | 10,000 TPS + sub-second finality enables real-time rewards | Reward hits your wallet in 0.5 seconds |
| 💸 **Payment Protocol** | X402 | Standardized agent-to-server payment handshake | Autonomous claim flow without manual signing |
| 🛡️ **Privacy** | Unlink SDK | Shielded transactions make stress patterns unlinkable | Your employer funds the pool but never sees your stress frequency |
| 🎵 **UX** | Tone.js | 432Hz binaural audio scientifically reduces cortisol | Neurochemical conditioning creates habit formation |

**Key Innovation:** The X402 agent operates autonomously—no manual wallet signing for each claim.

## 🏗️ Local Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Electricgoatpod/PrivaPulse.git
   cd PrivaPulse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment variables**  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set any optional vars (e.g. `VITE_CLAIM_REWARD_URL` for the claim API).

4. **Launch**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   In a separate terminal (for the X402 claim API):
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173/
- **Claim API:** http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Scripts
