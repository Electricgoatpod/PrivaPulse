# PrivaPulse

PrivaPulse is an autonomous, privacy-first agent that transforms real-time biometric wellness into shielded rewards on Monad by using EZKL proofs to navigate the X402 protocol without ever compromising user identity. 

PrivaPulse monitors biometric stability. When a user achieves 'Zen' (verified via EZKL), the Agent autonomously claims a $PRP reward. If the server challenges the claim with an X402 error, the Agent resolves it using a shielded Unlink vault.

## ⚡ Why Monad?

Health interventions require immediate feedback. We utilized Monad's parallelized EVM execution to:

- Handle real-time HRV data streams.
- Verify ZK-proofs generated by EZKL with minimal latency.
- Provide a seamless "Zen" experience without waiting for traditional block times.

## 🛡️ Why Unlink?

In the "Stress Diagnose-Meditate (SDM)" Framework, every reward payout creates a public "on-chain fingerprint" that links a specific biometric event (like a stress spike) to a user's public wallet address. Over time, this allows third parties to de-anonymize a user's medical history simply by tracking reward transactions. We used Unlink to 'un-link' the health event from the financial reward. It turns a public medical record into a private wellness incentive.

## Technical Stack Highlights

1. Blockchain: Monad (High-performance execution).

2. Payment Protocol: X402 (Standardized agent-to-server payments).

3. Privacy: Unlink SDK (Shielded, non-custodial payouts).

4. ZK-Proofs: EZKL (Verifying biometric "Zen" states without revealing raw data).
   
## 🎨 Features

- **Apple Health Simulation:** Mimics iOS 17 health permissions and real-time HRV monitoring.
- **Vibe-Engine:** Automated 432Hz binaural drone triggers upon stress-spike detection (28ms HRV).
- **Shadow Dashboard:** A "Blurred-by-Default" UI allowing for selective disclosure of health reputation via ZK-QR codes.

## 🏗️ Local Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Electricgoatpod/PrivaPulse.git
   cd PrivaPulse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment variables**  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set any optional vars (e.g. `VITE_CLAIM_REWARD_URL` for the claim API).

4. **Launch**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   In a separate terminal (for the X402 claim API):
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173/
- **Claim API:** http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run server` — run X402 claim backend (port 5000)
